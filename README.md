simple_timer
============

Simple timer html page. That's it.

Pass a number of minutes in the url 

http://.../timer.html?min=123

or enter it in the box provided in the format

[hours]:[mins]:[seconds]

Stop - will pause the timer
Start - will resume it.
Restart - makes jumping bunnies dance across the screen.

[or maybe that's just in my local fork]

Motivation
==========

I was using http://www.online-stopwatch.com/ but found I wanted to know how long ago the timer had stopped, so I made one that keeps counting.

But that's not all!
==============

With every count down timer we will also throw in, not 4, not 2, but 1 hardly used "work_days_left" page. It'll help you judge the exact amount of impending doom you should be experiencing.  Enjoy!  (Date of doom is customizable)

http://.../work_days_left.html?date=[year]-[month]-[day]
