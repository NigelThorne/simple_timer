simple_timer
============

Simple timer html page. That's it.

Pass a number of minutes in the url 

http://.../timer.html?min=123

or enter it in the box provided in the format

[hours]:[mins]:[seconds]

Stop - will pause the timer
Start - will resume it.
Restart - makes jumping bunnes dance across the screen.

[or maybe that's just in my local fork]

Motivation
==========

I was using http://www.online-stopwatch.com/ but found I wanted to know how long ago the timer had stopped, so I made one that keeps counting.
